# Large-Companies-Ireland

This is a mini project to compile a list of larger Irish companies.
The goal it to update the current list in Wikipedia which is not very good. Its based on the Fortune magazine list.
I think with access to open corporates data the Wikipedia data can be expanded and become more accurate.

Ireland was chosen as an example as its 1) Local 2) Small 3) Relevent as many non-Irish companies like Google and Apple are domiciled there 4) The avaialability of this dataset can be expanded
